In this blog post, youâ€™ll create several interesting, interactive data graphics using the [NOAA climate data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly).

First of all, start by importing all the necessary libraries. 
```python
import pandas as pd 
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## Step 1: Create a Database

You want to keep the data as three different tables in your database. 
Also, note that "whitespace" can be hard to work with. Hence, it may be useful to rename some columns. 
After you're done, it is a good idea to inspect your data. 
```python
temps = pd.read_csv("temps_stacked.csv")
temps.head()
```
