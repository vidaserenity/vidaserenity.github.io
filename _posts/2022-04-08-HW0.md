In this post, you will be shown how to a helpful visualization of a data set. 
Specifically, we will be working with the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data set.

## Step 1: Prepare the data

Remember to first import your libraries. 
Then, you can read the data into Python by running: 
```python
import pandas as pd
from plotly import express as px
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
You can clean your data by dropping unnecessary data and simplify some names such as the penguins `Species`. 
```python
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]

cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]
penguins = penguins[cols]
```

## Step 2: Inspect the data

Once you are done, always remember to look at a data to understand what variables you are working with. 
You can look at a preview of the data by running the `head()` function. 
This will give you the first five rows of your dataset:

## Step 3: Make the plot

Now comes the fun part. You can make the plot by using the `scatter()` function. 
Feel free to play around with the arguments depending on what you want to focus on and highlight. 
```python
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, #data that needs to be plotted
                 x = "Culmen Length (mm)", #col name for x-axis
                 y = "Culmen Depth (mm)", #col name for y-axis
                 color = "Species", #col name for color coding
                 size = "Body Mass (g)", #col name for size of points
                 size_max = 8,
                 opacity = 0.5,
                 hover_name = "Species", #col name
                 hover_data = ["Island", "Sex"], #list of col names
                 width = 500,
                 height = 300)
                 
# reduce whitespace
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
# show the plot
fig.show()
```

## Step 4: Be Proud of Yourself

You just created a graph with Python! Good job and be proud! :)

Something that I felt I did really well on this part was the organization of this page. 
  It took me a quite a while to get the installations done so I was running behind. But I finally got everything to work!
  I even put up quite favicons which I am very happy about. Also, never thought that I could create a blog post like this myself. 
  Can't wait to work on more exciting projects throughout this quarter.
