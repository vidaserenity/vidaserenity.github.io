# Web Scraping

In this Blog Post, you’ll use webscraping to answer the following question:
> What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie or show?

## §1. Setup

Choose a movie you want to work with. 
For this example, I'll be working with the movie "Just Go With It" cause I like Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston but feel free to choose whoever you like!
Now locate the Starting IMDB Page:
```python
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564367/
```

Next, you want to initialize your project

1. Create a new GitHub repository, and sync it with GitHub Desktop. This repository will house your scraper. **You should commit and push each time you make significant changes to your code.**
2. Open a terminal in the location of your repository on your laptop, and type: 
```
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```

## §2. Write Your Scraper

Create a file inside the `spiders` directory called `imdb_spider.py`. Add the following lines to the file: 

```python
# to run 
# scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv

import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564367/']
    
    #insert parse(self, response) method
    #insert parse_full_credit(self, response) method
    #insert parse_actor_page(self, response) method
```
Replace the entry of `start_urls` with the URL corresponding to your favorite movie or TV show. 

Now, implement the three parsing methods for the ImdbSpider class.
- parse(self, response)
```python
def parse(self, response):
    """
    Assumes that you start on a movie page, and then navigate to the Cast & Crew page.
    Yielded request should specify the method parse_full_credit(self, response) should be called.
    """
        next_page = response.css("li.ipc-metadata-list__item a::attr(href)").getall()[1]
        if next_page:
            next_page = response.urljoin(next_page)
            yield scrapy.Request(next_page, callback = self.parse_full_credit)
```
- parse_full_credits(self, response)
```python
def parse_full_credit(self, response):
    """
    Assumes that you start on the Cast & Crew page. 
    Purpose: yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page. 
    Note: Crew members are not included. 
    Yielded request should specify the method parse_actor_page(self, response) should be called when the actor’s page is reached. 
    """
        for links in response.css("table.cast_list td.primary_photo a::attr(href)").getall():
            if links:
                actors = response.urljoin(links)
                yield scrapy.Request(actors, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```
- parse_actor_page(self, response)
```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    """
    Assumes that you start on the page of an actor. 
    Purpose: yield a dictionary with two key-value pairs, of the form {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}.
    """
        actor_name = response.css("td.name-overview-widget__section span.itemprop::text").get()
        for onemovie in response.css("div.filmo-row b a::text").getall():
            yield{
                "actor" : actor_name,
                "movie_or_TV_name" : onemovie
            }
```

Now run your code by typing the following line in the anaconda command prompt (terminal):
```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```
This will run your spider and save a CSV file called results.csv, with columns for actor names and the movies and TV shows on which they worked.

## §3. Make Your Recommendations

Your goal is to compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors with your favorite movie or TV show. 

Start by importing pandas and reading in the `results.csv` file.
```python
import pandas as pd
results = pd.read_csv("results.csv", sep = ",")

results
```
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hw2_1.png" width=50% height=50%>

Now you wanna generate a table with two columns
- movie
- number of shared actors

```python
# Remove repeated movies
movie_TV_list = list(set(results["movie_or_TV_name"].tolist()))

# Count the number of shared actors in each movie
actors_count = [(results.movie_or_TV_name == movie).sum() for movie in movie_TV_list]

# Generate a new data frame with the computed numbers
recommendations = pd.DataFrame(data = {"movie":movie_TV_list,"number of shared actors":actors_count})

recommendations
```
![hw2_2.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/hw2_2.png | width=250)


Last but not least, sort the list and output the recommendation table
```python
# Sort the movies by number of shared actors
recommendations = recommendations.sort_values(by="number of shared actors", ascending=False )

# Reset the indexing
recommendations = recommendations.reset_index()
recommendations = recommendations.drop("index", axis =1)

# Drop the first axis which should correspond to the movie you chose
recommendations.drop(index=0, 
        axis=0, 
        inplace=True)

#Output the first 10 movies
recommendations.head(10)
```
![hw2_3.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/hw2_3.png | width=250)

## §4. Visualize your data 

You can also choose to show your data with a simple visualization using `plotly`
```python
from plotly import express as px
fig = px.bar(data_frame = recommendations.head(10),
             x = "movie",
             y = "number of shared actors",
             hover_name = "movie",
             width = 700,
             height = 500)
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
```
![hw2_4.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/hw2_4.png | width=250)

## §5. Be Proud of Yourself

You did a great job! Now go take a break :)

 {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">
 To be honest, I actually really enjoyed doing this homework! Finally felt like all the python coding I learnt is actually useful.
  The assignment was not too long as well. It was fun!
