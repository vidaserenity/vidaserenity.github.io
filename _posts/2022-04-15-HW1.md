In this blog post, youâ€™ll create several interesting, interactive data graphics using the [NOAA climate data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly).

First of all, start by importing all the necessary libraries. 
```python
import pandas as pd 
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## Step 1: Create a Database

You want to keep the data as three different tables in your database. 
Also, note that "whitespace" can be hard to work with. Hence, it may be useful to rename some columns. 
After you're done, it is a good idea to inspect your data. 
```python
temps = pd.read_csv("temps_stacked.csv")
temps.head()
```
![HW1_tempstable.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_tempstable.png)
```python
countries = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4":"FIPS_10_4"})
countries.head()
```
![HW1_countriestable.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_countriestable.png)
```python
stations = pd.read_csv("station-metadata.csv")
stations.head()
```
![HW1_stationstable.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_stationstable.png)

And, you are good to go!

## Step 2: Write a Query Function

In this post, you will be using SQL. SQL works similar to pandas but with very different syntax. 
Firstly, open a connection to `temps.db` so that you can "talk" to it using Python.
Always remember to also close your connection. 

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
temps.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

conn.close()
```

Now, load the data into a pandas dataframe for downstream data analysis tasks. 
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
cmd = \
"""
SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Name, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
FROM temperatures T
LEFT JOIN stations S on T.id = S.id
LEFT JOIN countries C on C.FIPS_10_4 = SUBSTRING(S.id, 1, 2)
"""

df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
conn.close()
```

Next, create a function so that we can easily select specific parts of the data.

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    
    df_1 = df.dropna()
    df_1 = df_1[df_1["Name"] == country]
    df_1 = df_1[(df_1["Year"] >= year_begin) & (df_1["Year"] <= year_end)]
    df_1 = df_1[df_1["Month"] == month]
    df_1 = df_1.rename(columns = {"Name":"Country"}).reset_index()
    df_1 = df_1.drop("index", axis = 1)

    return df_1
    
#For example:
query_climate_database(country = "India",
                      year_begin = 1980, 
                      year_end = 2020, 
                      month = 1)
```

![HW1_indiaExample.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_indiaExample.png)

## Step 3: Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

The next part is going to be useful in answering some statistical questions. 
Specifically we want to answer:
- How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?
You want to start with writing some function that you may need in your plotting functions.
In this case we want to use Linear Regression to estimate the increase in temperature

```python
def coef(data_group):
    X = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(X, y)
    slope = LR.coef_[0]
    return slope
```

To plot the Geograohic Function, we will be using the two functions we defined earlier,
as well as the `scatter_mapbox()` function. Feel free to play around with the variables and adjust the size and colors.
```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    df_2 = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    df_2 = df_2[df_2.groupby(["NAME", "Month"])["Year"].transform("count") >= min_obs]
    coefs = df_2.groupby(["NAME", "Month", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(data_frame = coefs,
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE",
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            hover_data = ["LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"],
                            color = 0,
                            color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                            width = 700,
                            height = 300,
                            **kwargs)
    
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return fig
```
```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map,
                                   title = "Estimates of Yearly Increase in Temperature in January for Stations in India, years 1980 - 2020")
fig.show()
```

![HW1_Indiageoscatter.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_Indiageoscatter.png)

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
Everything seems to be working! However, I am not sure why my title is not showing up in the plot. 
I tried a lot of different ways :( It doesn't show up for any of my plots.
It looks to be "cutoff". So I might need help with this. 
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

Now, let's try the same function with a different country and a different time period
```python
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("Indonesia", 1985, 2015, 8, 
                                   min_obs = 5,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map,
                                  title = "Estimates of Yearly Increase in Temperature in August for Stations in Indonesia, years 1985 - 2015",)
fig.set()
fig.show()
```

## Step 4: Create More Functions and Visualizations

> Question: Which country has the hottest temperature in a specific month and year?

Again, we would first need to define the query function as such:
```python
def query_climate_year(year, month):
    
    df_1 = df.dropna()
    df_1 = df_1[df_1["Year"] == year]
    df_1 = df_1[df_1["Month"] == month]
    df_1 = df_1.rename(columns = {"Name":"Country"}).reset_index()
    df_1 = df_1.drop("index", axis = 1)

    return df_1

#Let's take August of 2000 as an example
query_climate_year(2000, 8)
 ```
 ![HW1_quaryyear.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_quaryyear.png)
 
 Now to create our plot. This step is very similar to step 3 so feel free to play around
 ```python
 def highest_increase_in_temp_plot(year, month, **kwargs):
    df_2 = query_climate_year(year, month)
    coefs = df_2.groupby(["Country","Year", "Month"])["Country","Temp"].apply(max)
    print(coefs)
    fig = px.bar(data_frame = coefs,
                            x = "Country",
                            y = "Temp",
                            hover_name = "Country",
                            color = "Temp",
                            color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                            width = 1000,
                            height = 500,
                            **kwargs)
    
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return fig
 ```
 ```python
 fig = highest_increase_in_temp_plot(2000, 8)

 fig.show()
 ```

 > Question: How does the latitude (distance to equator) affect the increase in temperature?
 
 Here, we will be re-using our `query_climate_database()` function:
 ```python
 def temp_by_lat(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    df_2 = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    df_2 = df_2[df_2.groupby(["NAME", "Month"])["Year"].transform("count") >= min_obs]
    df_2["LATITUDE"] = df_2["LATITUDE"].abs()
    coefs = df_2.groupby(["NAME", "Month", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    fig = px.scatter(data_frame = coefs,
                            x = "LATITUDE",
                            y = 0,
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            hover_data = ["LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"],
                            color = "LATITUDE",
                            color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                            width = 700,
                            height = 300,
                            **kwargs)
    
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return fig
 ```
 ```python
 fig = temp_by_lat("China", 1985, 2015, 2, 5,
           size_max = 8,
           opacity = 0.5,
           marginal_y = "box",
           marginal_x = "violin")

fig.update_layout(title="Increase in Temperature of Stations in China based on Latitude (Distance from Equator)",
                  yaxis_title="Estimated Increase in Temperature")
fig.show()
 ```

 ## Step 5: Go Rest!
 
 You've probably been working on this for a while! So be proud that you got to this point and go rest.
