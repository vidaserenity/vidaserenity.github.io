In this blog post, you will learn several new skills and concepts related to image classification in Tensorflow.
- Tensorflow Datasets provide a convenient way for us to organize operations on our training, validation, and test data sets.
- Data augmentation allows us to create expanded versions of our data sets that allow models to learn patterns more robustly.
- Transfer learning allows us to use pre-trained models for new tasks.
You will be teaching a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between pictures of dogs and pictures of cats.
